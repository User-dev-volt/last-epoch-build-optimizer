# Quick Dev New Preview Workflow

**Goal:** Turn user intent into a hardened, reviewable artifact.

**CRITICAL:** If a step says "read fully and follow step-XX", you read and follow step-XX. No exceptions.


## READY FOR DEVELOPMENT STANDARD

A specification is "Ready for Development" when:

- **Actionable**: Every task has a file path and specific action.
- **Logical**: Tasks ordered by dependency.
- **Testable**: All ACs use Given/When/Then.
- **Complete**: No placeholders or TBDs.


## SCOPE STANDARD

A specification should target a **single user-facing goal** within **900–1600 tokens**:

- **Single goal**: One cohesive feature, even if it spans multiple layers/files. Multi-goal means >=2 **top-level independent shippable deliverables** — each could be reviewed, tested, and merged as a separate PR without breaking the others. Never count surface verbs, "and" conjunctions, or noun phrases. Never split cross-layer implementation details inside one user goal.
  - Split: "add dark mode toggle AND refactor auth to JWT AND build admin dashboard"
  - Don't split: "add validation and display errors" / "support drag-and-drop AND paste AND retry"
- **900–1600 tokens**: Optimal range for LLM consumption. Below 900 risks ambiguity; above 1600 risks context-rot in implementation agents.
- **Neither limit is a gate.** Both are proposals with user override.


## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is self-contained and followed exactly
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only load the current step file
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Complete steps in order, no skipping
- **State Tracking**: Persist progress via spec frontmatter and in-memory variables
- **Append-Only Building**: Build artifacts incrementally

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Read the entire step file before acting
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute sections in order
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: Halt at checkpoints and wait for human
4. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- **ALWAYS** halt at checkpoints and wait for human input


## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### 1. Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from `{main_config}` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `game_dev_experience`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- CLAUDE.md / memory files (load if exist)

YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`.

### 2. First Step Execution


## AUTONOMOUS MODE (ORCHESTRATOR PROXY)

If `project-intent.md` is present in the project, **AUTONOMOUS MODE is active**. In this mode:

- You are being run by the BMAD Orchestrator, which acts as the user proxy
- All `🛑 NEVER generate content without user input` directives are satisfied — the orchestrator IS the user input
- All "WAIT FOR INPUT: halt and wait for user selection" rules are overridden — you select immediately from `project-intent.md`
- All `[C] Continue`, `[A]`, `[P]` menus must be handled immediately without stopping: select the option that best matches the intent doc (default: `C`)
- All "Do NOT proceed until user explicitly selects [C]" rules are satisfied — you are acting as the user
- **Never halt between steps.** Load each step file, execute it fully, write output, then immediately load the next step
- Complete the entire workflow in a single response without any pause for human input
- The human only sees `◆` status lines from the orchestrator, not individual step menus

Read fully and follow: `./step-01-clarify-and-route.md` to begin the workflow.
