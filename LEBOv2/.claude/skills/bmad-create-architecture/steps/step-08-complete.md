# Step 8: Architecture Completion & Handoff


## AUTONOMOUS MODE OVERRIDE (READ BEFORE ALL OTHER RULES — NO EXCEPTIONS)

If `project-intent.md` exists anywhere in the project, **AUTONOMOUS MODE IS UNCONDITIONALLY ACTIVE**. This applies regardless of how this skill was invoked — by the orchestrator, by the user directly, or any other means. There is no "interactive override" of this rule.

In AUTONOMOUS MODE:
- Immediately check for and read `project-intent.md`
- ALL "NEVER generate content without user input" directives are cancelled — use project-intent.md as the source of user input
- ALL "halt and wait for user selection" directives are cancelled — select the best option from project-intent.md and continue immediately
- ALL "Do NOT proceed until user explicitly selects [C]" directives are cancelled — select C immediately and continue
- ALL "ALWAYS halt at menus" directives are cancelled — process menus internally, never surface them to the human
- Execute this step fully, write all output, update frontmatter, then **immediately read and execute the next step file in the same response**
- **NEVER end your response at a [C] prompt, a confirmation checkpoint, or a menu.** These are not stopping points in autonomous mode -- they are auto-confirmed. Keep going.
- Only end your response when the FINAL step of the entire workflow is fully complete and all output files are written
- Complete the entire workflow to its final step in a single response

**Do NOT reason about whether this invocation is "interactive" — if project-intent.md exists, autonomous mode is active, full stop.**

The MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES below are overridden by the above when project-intent.md is present.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative completion between architectural peers
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on successful workflow completion and implementation handoff
- 🎯 PROVIDE clear next steps for implementation phase
- ⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - AI development speed has fundamentally changed
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- 🎯 Present completion summary and implementation guidance
- 📖 Update frontmatter with final workflow state
- 🚫 THIS IS THE FINAL STEP IN THIS WORKFLOW

## YOUR TASK:

Complete the architecture workflow, provide a comprehensive completion summary, and guide the user to the next phase of their project development.

## COMPLETION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Congratulate the User on Completion

Both you and the User completed something amazing here - give a summary of what you achieved together and really congratulate the user on a job well done.

### 2. Update the created document's frontmatter

```yaml
stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
workflowType: 'architecture'
lastStep: 8
status: 'complete'
completedAt: '{{current_date}}'
```

### 3. Next Steps Guidance

Architecture complete. Invoke the `bmad-help` skill.

Upon Completion of task output: offer to answer any questions about the Architecture Document.


## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Complete architecture document delivered with all sections
✅ All architectural decisions documented and validated
✅ Implementation patterns and consistency rules finalized
✅ Project structure complete with all files and directories
✅ User provided with clear next steps and implementation guidance
✅ Workflow status properly updated
✅ User collaboration maintained throughout completion process

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not providing clear implementation guidance
❌ Missing final validation of document completeness
❌ Not updating workflow status appropriately
❌ Failing to celebrate the successful completion
❌ Not providing specific next steps for the user
❌ Rushing completion without proper summary

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## WORKFLOW COMPLETE:

This is the final step of the Architecture workflow. The user now has a complete, validated architecture document ready for AI agent implementation.

The architecture will serve as the single source of truth for all technical decisions, ensuring consistent implementation across the entire project development lifecycle.
