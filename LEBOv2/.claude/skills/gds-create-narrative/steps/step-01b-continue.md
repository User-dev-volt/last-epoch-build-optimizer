# Step 1b: Continue Existing Narrative

**Resuming Narrative Workflow**

## STEP GOAL:

Load the existing narrative document, determine progress, and route to the appropriate next step.


## AUTONOMOUS MODE OVERRIDE (READ BEFORE ALL OTHER RULES — NO EXCEPTIONS)

If `project-intent.md` exists anywhere in the project, **AUTONOMOUS MODE IS UNCONDITIONALLY ACTIVE**. This applies regardless of how this skill was invoked — by the orchestrator, by the user directly, or any other means. There is no "interactive override" of this rule.

In AUTONOMOUS MODE:
- Immediately check for and read `project-intent.md`
- ALL "NEVER generate content without user input" directives are cancelled — use project-intent.md as the source of user input
- ALL "halt and wait for user selection" directives are cancelled — select the best option from project-intent.md and continue immediately
- ALL "Do NOT proceed until user explicitly selects [C]" directives are cancelled — select C immediately and continue
- ALL "ALWAYS halt at menus" directives are cancelled — process menus internally, never surface them to the human
- Execute this step fully, write all output, update frontmatter, then **immediately read and execute the next step file in the same response**
- **NEVER end your response at a [C] prompt, a confirmation checkpoint, or a menu.** These are not stopping points in autonomous mode -- they are auto-confirmed. Keep going.
- Only end your response when the FINAL step of the entire workflow is fully complete and all output files are written
- Complete the entire workflow to its final step in a single response

**Do NOT reason about whether this invocation is "interactive" — if project-intent.md exists, autonomous mode is active, full stop.**

The MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES below are overridden by the above when project-intent.md is present.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- NEVER mention time estimates
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Step-Specific Rules:

- Parse frontmatter to determine completed steps
- Present summary of current progress
- Route to correct next step based on state

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Load Existing Narrative

**Read the existing narrative document:**

Load `{outputFile}` and parse the frontmatter to extract:

- `stepsCompleted` array
- `status`
- `project` name
- `narrativeComplexity`
- GDD reference

### 2. Analyze Progress

**Determine workflow state:**

Map completed steps to workflow progress:

- Step 1: Initialize
- Step 2: Foundation (premise, themes, structure)
- Step 3: Story (beats and pacing)
- Step 4: Characters (all characters and arcs)
- Step 5: World (world, history, locations)
- Step 6: Dialogue (dialogue systems)
- Step 7: Environmental (environmental storytelling)
- Step 8: Delivery (narrative delivery methods)
- Step 9: Integration (gameplay integration)
- Step 10: Production (scope and planning)
- Step 11: Complete

**Calculate next step:**

Find the highest completed step and determine the next step file to load.

### 3. Present Continuation Summary

"**Resuming Narrative Workflow**

{{user_name}}, I found your existing narrative for **{{game_name}}**.

**Progress:** Steps completed: {{stepsCompleted}}

**Narrative Complexity:** {{narrativeComplexity}}

**Sections Completed:**
{{list_of_completed_sections}}

**Current Status:**

- Last completed: {{last_step_name}}
- Next step: {{next_step_name}} (Step {{next_step_number}} of 11)

Would you like to:

1. **Continue** - Resume from {{next_step_name}}
2. **Review** - Show me what we've written so far
3. **Restart Step** - Redo the last completed step

Select an option:"

### 4. Handle User Selection

**If Continue:**

- Load the next step file based on `stepsCompleted`

**If Review:**

- Present summary of all completed sections
- Show key narrative elements (premise, characters, etc.)
- Return to continuation options

**If Restart Step:**

- Decrement stepsCompleted to remove last step
- Load the step file for the step being restarted

### 5. Route to Next Step

Based on next step number, load the appropriate step file:

| Next Step | File     |
| --------- | -------- |
| 2         | {step02} |
| 3         | {step03} |
| 4         | {step04} |
| 5         | {step05} |
| 6         | {step06} |
| 7         | {step07} |
| 8         | {step08} |
| 9         | {step09} |
| 10        | {step10} |
| 11        | {step11} |

## SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### SUCCESS:

- Existing document loaded and parsed
- Progress accurately determined
- User presented with clear options
- Correct step file loaded based on state

### SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Failing to parse frontmatter correctly
- Loading wrong step file
- Not presenting continuation options
- Overwriting existing progress without confirmation

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
