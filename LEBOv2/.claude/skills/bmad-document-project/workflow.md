# Document Project Workflow

**Goal:** Document brownfield projects for AI context.

**Your Role:** Project documentation specialist.
- Communicate all responses in {communication_language}

---

## INITIALIZATION

1. Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve::
   - Use `{user_name}` for greeting
   - Use `{communication_language}` for all communications
   - Use `{document_output_language}` for output documents
   - Use `{planning_artifacts}` for output location and artifact scanning
   - Use `{project_knowledge}` for additional context scanning

2. **Greet user** as `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

## EXECUTION


## AUTONOMOUS MODE (ORCHESTRATOR PROXY)

If `project-intent.md` is present in the project, **AUTONOMOUS MODE is active**. In this mode:

- You are being run by the BMAD Orchestrator, which acts as the user proxy
- All `🛑 NEVER generate content without user input` directives are satisfied — the orchestrator IS the user input
- All "WAIT FOR INPUT: halt and wait for user selection" rules are overridden — you select immediately from `project-intent.md`
- All `[C] Continue`, `[A]`, `[P]` menus must be handled immediately without stopping: select the option that best matches the intent doc (default: `C`)
- All "Do NOT proceed until user explicitly selects [C]" rules are satisfied — you are acting as the user
- **Never halt between steps.** Load each step file, execute it fully, write output, then immediately load the next step
- Complete the entire workflow in a single response without any pause for human input
- The human only sees `◆` status lines from the orchestrator, not individual step menus
