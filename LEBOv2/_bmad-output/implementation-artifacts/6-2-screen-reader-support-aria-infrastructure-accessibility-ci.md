# Story 6.2: Screen Reader Support, ARIA Infrastructure & Accessibility CI

Status: review

## Story

As an advanced Last Epoch player who uses assistive technology,
I want screen reader announcements for all dynamic content changes — suggestion updates, build optimization progress, error states — and complete ARIA compliance throughout the app,
So that the tool is fully usable with NVDA (Windows) and VoiceOver (macOS) without any functionality gaps.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** axe-core is integrated into the Vitest suite
**When** any CI build runs
**Then** axe-core automatically audits WCAG 2.1 AA compliance on the main view and settings view
**And** any axe violation causes the build to fail — no accessibility regressions can ship

**Given** AI optimization is running
**When** the loading state becomes active (`isOptimizing` → true)
**Then** the `#ai-status-region` `aria-live="polite"` region announces "Analyzing your build..." to screen readers

**Given** AI optimization completes
**When** `hasOptimizationCompleted` → true
**Then** the `#ai-status-region` region announces "Optimization complete. [N] suggestions available"

**Given** a critical error occurs (API failure, stream error)
**When** `streamError` transitions to a non-null value
**Then** the `#critical-error-region` `aria-live="assertive"` region announces the error message immediately

**Given** the user navigates to a SuggestionCard
**When** a card receives keyboard focus (via Up/Down nav from Story 6.1)
**Then** the screen reader announces full card content: "[Rank N] [change type] [node name] — [description]. Damage: [before] → [after]. Survivability: [before] → [after]. Speed: [before] → [after]. [Explanation text]" (UX-DR5)

**Given** any interactive element with a `focus:outline-none` override
**When** it receives keyboard focus
**Then** a 2px solid accent-gold focus ring is visible (or an equivalent custom focus indicator)

**Given** the user has `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` set in OS preferences
**When** optimization loading pulses or PixiJS node glow animations run
**Then** PixiJS animation effects (glow intensity, pulse) are disabled at the JavaScript level
**And** all functional state is still communicated by static visual indicators

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Install vitest-axe and configure (AC: 1)
  - [x] `pnpm add -D vitest-axe` from the `lebo/` directory
  - [x] In `lebo/src/test-setup.ts`, add:
    ```ts
    import { toHaveNoViolations } from 'vitest-axe'
    expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)
    ```
  - [x] Verify `vitest-axe` exports: `{ axe, toHaveNoViolations }` — the `axe` function wraps `axe-core` and accepts a DOM container element

- [x] Task 2: Write axe integration tests for main view and settings view (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `lebo/src/App.a11y.test.tsx`:
    - Mock all Tauri commands (pattern: `vi.mock('@tauri-apps/api/core', () => ({ invoke: vi.fn() }))`)
    - Mock `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater` (already mocked in other test files — copy pattern)
    - Render `<App />` with default store state (no active build, no suggestions)
    - Run `axe(container)` and assert `toHaveNoViolations()`
    - Second test: set store to settings view (`useAppStore.getState().setCurrentView('settings')`) and re-render + re-run axe
  - [x] The axe tests render component trees against jsdom — PixiJS canvas will not mount (no WebGL in jsdom); this is expected. The overlay div and non-canvas DOM will be audited.
  - [x] Pass `{ rules: { 'color-contrast': { enabled: false } } }` to `axe()` only if color-contrast violations appear that are false positives from the dark theme (jsdom doesn't compute CSS custom property contrast). Do NOT blanket-disable other rules.
  - [x] If a violation is found, fix the component rather than disabling the rule

- [x] Task 3: Wire live region content announcements (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create `lebo/src/shared/hooks/useAccessibilityAnnouncer.ts`
  - [x] Call `useAccessibilityAnnouncer()` in `App.tsx` — add to the hook call list at the top of `App()`
  - [x] Do NOT touch `import-progress-region`
  - [x] When `isOptimizing` goes false (optimization ends or errors), also clear `#ai-status-region`

- [x] Task 4: Fix `focus:outline-none` violations — components that remove the global focus ring with no replacement (AC: 6)
  - [x] **`SkillTreeTabBar.tsx`** — `Tab` component: replaced `focus:outline-none` with `data-[focus]:outline data-[focus]:outline-2 data-[focus]:outline-[var(--color-accent-gold)] data-[focus]:outline-offset-[-2px]`
  - [x] **`GoalSelector.tsx`** — `Radio` component: replaced `focus:outline-none` with `data-[focus]:outline data-[focus]:outline-2 data-[focus]:outline-[var(--color-accent-gold)]`
  - [x] **`SavedBuildsList.tsx`** — rename `<input>`: removed `outline: 'none'`, added `focus:outline focus:outline-1 focus:outline-[var(--color-accent-gold)]`
  - [x] **`ClassMasterySelector.tsx`** — left as-is (Headless UI manages focus internally)

- [x] Task 5: Enhance SuggestionCard aria-label with score deltas (AC: 5)
  - [x] In `SuggestionCard.tsx`, updated `ariaLabel` with `formatScore()` and full score before/after format
  - [x] Update `SuggestionCard.test.tsx` to assert the new aria-label format includes score values

- [x] Task 6: Create `useReducedMotion` hook and apply to PixiJS renderer (AC: 7)
  - [x] Created `lebo/src/shared/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts`
  - [x] Added `setReducedMotion(enabled: boolean): void` to `RendererInstance` in `types.ts`
  - [x] Implemented in `pixiRenderer.ts`: `reducedMotionEnabled` flag stored in closure; when true, skips the glow halo (pulsing outer alpha circle) in `drawSuggested`
  - [x] In `SkillTreeCanvas.tsx`, calls `useReducedMotion()` and passes to renderer via `useEffect`
  - [x] Added `useReducedMotion.test.ts` — matchMedia mock, initial state, change handler

- [x] Task 7: Tests (all ACs)
  - [x] `App.a11y.test.tsx` — axe audit for main view and settings view (Task 2 above)
  - [x] `useAccessibilityAnnouncer.test.ts` — test region injection: isOptimizing→true, completion with count, streamError injection, clear on abort
  - [x] `useReducedMotion.test.ts` — matchMedia mock, initial state, change handler
  - [x] `SuggestionCard.test.tsx` — extend existing test: assert aria-label includes "Damage: X → Y" format
  - [x] `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean
  - [x] `pnpm vitest run` — all 459 tests passing

## Dev Notes

### What's Already Done — Do NOT Re-implement

Story 6.1 and prior work delivered these — verify they pass axe rather than re-build them:

- **Skip links** in `App.tsx` lines 139–152: `href="#skill-tree-canvas"` and `href="#suggestion-panel"`, rendered as `sr-only` until focused, then gold-background. These already satisfy the skip-link AC. The axe audit will verify the href targets exist.
- **ARIA live region divs** in `App.tsx` lines 155–157: `import-progress-region` (polite), `ai-status-region` (polite), `critical-error-region` (assertive) — the DOM nodes exist; Task 3 wires content.
- **Reduced motion CSS** in `global.css` lines 73–82: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` kills all `animation-duration` and `transition-duration` globally. This covers all CSS animations (`animate-pulse` in OptimizeButton, `transition-[width]` in ScoreGauge, panel collapse transitions). Task 6 adds the JS-side hook for PixiJS only.
- **Global focus ring** in `global.css` lines 84–88: `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--color-accent-gold) }` — applies to all interactive elements. Task 4 fixes the components that override this with `focus:outline-none` without a replacement.
- **SuggestionCard** `role="article"` + `aria-label` + `tabIndex={-1}` — from Story 6.1. Task 5 enhances the label content.
- **SkillTreeCanvas overlay buttons** with `aria-label="${id} — ${state}"` — from Story 6.1.

### vitest-axe Usage Pattern

```ts
import { axe } from 'vitest-axe'
import 'vitest-axe/extend-expect'  // or use test-setup.ts extension

const { container } = render(<App />)
const results = await axe(container)
expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
```

The `axe()` call is async — always `await` it. Results include `violations`, `passes`, `incomplete`. `toHaveNoViolations()` checks that `violations` is empty.

**PixiJS canvas in jsdom:** PixiJS will throw or silently fail WebGL init in jsdom. The SkillTreeCanvas component has guards for missing renderer — the overlay div and all non-canvas DOM will still render. The axe audit audits the DOM tree, not the canvas pixels. This is the correct behavior for WCAG auditing.

**Color-contrast rule**: jsdom computes CSS custom properties as empty strings, which means contrast ratios will report 0:0 as "undefined". Disable this specific rule in the axe call to avoid false positives:
```ts
const results = await axe(container, {
  rules: { 'color-contrast': { enabled: false } }
})
```
This is the standard practice for design-token-heavy apps. All other rules must pass.

### Live Region Wiring — Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Do NOT set `textContent` directly** without clearing first. Screen readers only announce changes to `aria-live` regions — if the text is the same as the previous announcement (e.g., two back-to-back optimizations), the second announcement is silently dropped. The clear→rAF→set pattern in Task 3 forces a DOM mutation both times.
- **Do NOT use `innerHTML`** — use `textContent` only. No HTML in live regions.
- **Do NOT announce on every render** — use `useOptimizationStore.subscribe()` (Zustand subscription) to detect state *transitions*, not `useOptimizationStore()` (selector) which fires on every render that reads the value. The difference is critical for avoiding noise announcements.
- **`aria-live="assertive"` is for critical errors only** — it interrupts the current screen reader speech. Never use it for status updates or progress.

### Headless UI v2 Focus Indicators — `data-[focus]` vs `focus:`

Headless UI v2 adds `data-focus` attribute to the focused element rather than relying on `:focus` CSS pseudo-class. This means:
- Tailwind's `focus:` prefix does NOT work reliably on Headless UI primitives
- Use `data-[focus]:` prefix instead
- Example: `data-[focus]:outline data-[focus]:outline-2 data-[focus]:outline-[var(--color-accent-gold)]`
- This is why `GoalSelector` and `SkillTreeTabBar` currently have visual focus gaps — their `focus:outline-none` suppressed the global `:focus-visible` ring and no `data-[focus]:` replacement was added

### PixiJS Glow Animation — Where It Lives

The glow animation is in `pixiRenderer.ts` around line 180. The `isGlowing` flag (from `highlightedNodes.glowing.has(node.id)`) controls whether a node's alpha pulses. When `reducedMotionEnabled` is true:
- Set the glow node's alpha to a fixed value (e.g., `0.85`) instead of animating it
- Skip the sine/cosine time-based alpha calculation
- The gold ring and purple suggested overlay still render — only the pulsing animation is disabled

### SuggestionCard Label — Score Format

The `baselineScore` and `previewScore` objects have `damage`, `survivability`, `speed` fields (all `number | null`). Format `null` as `—` (em dash) since it means "no data for this axis". Do not format as `0` or `null`.

Screen readers will read "Damage: 47 → 52" as "Damage: 47 arrow 52" or "Damage: 47 to 52" depending on the reader. The `→` character (U+2192) is read as "right arrow" or "to" by NVDA and VoiceOver — acceptable.

### NFR16 — Manual Verification Required

NFR16 (tooltip readability at 100% system font scale) must be verified manually on Windows before marking story complete:
- Set Windows display scale to 100% (not 125% or 150%)
- Open app and verify `NodeTooltip`, `DataStalenessBar`, status bar text is readable
- This cannot be automated — note it in Dev Agent Record as verified

### Coding Patterns (from prior stories)

- Tailwind v4 CSS-first: `className` for layout/spacing, `style={{ color: 'var(--color-...)' }}` for design tokens
- No barrel `index.ts` — import directly from source files
- Tests co-located with source, `*.test.tsx` / `*.test.ts`
- Mock `@tauri-apps/api/core` via `vi.mock(...)` in any test that imports Tauri commands (required pattern — Tauri is unavailable in jsdom)
- `getState()` in event handlers/subscriptions, not store selectors
- `useReducedMotion` follows the same pattern as `useConnectivity` — read a system API, return boolean, reactive to changes

## Project Context

- Architecture: Tauri 2.x + React 19 + TypeScript + PixiJS v8 + Zustand v5 + Tailwind v4 + Headless UI v2
- Stack: [architecture.md](../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md)
- Epics: [epics.md](../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md) — Epic 6, Story 6.2
- UX spec: [ux-design-specification.md](../_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md) — Accessibility Strategy at ~line 874; UX-DR5 (SuggestionCard screen reader label)
- Previous story: [6-1-keyboard-navigation-global-shortcuts.md](./6-1-keyboard-navigation-global-shortcuts.md) — all keyboard nav + invisible-button overlay built there; story 6.2 layers ARIA announcements on top

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Plan

Implemented in task order as specified. Key decisions:
- `vitest-axe` v0.1.0 uses the old `Vi.Assertion` namespace — added `lebo/src/vitest-axe.d.ts` to augment the current Vitest 4.x `Assertion` interface instead. Also added `window.matchMedia` global mock to `test-setup.ts` since jsdom doesn't provide it.
- `useReducedMotion` is called at the component level in `SkillTreeCanvas` and propagated to the renderer via a `useEffect`. Since there is no ticker-based animation loop currently, the `setReducedMotion` flag disables the outer glow halo (`alpha: 0.25` circle) drawn by `drawSuggested` — the static ring and node color still render.
- `useAccessibilityAnnouncer` uses `useOptimizationStore.subscribe` (state transitions), not `useOptimizationStore` (renders), to avoid noise announcements.
- NFR16 (tooltip readability at 100% display scale) requires manual Windows verification before final sign-off.

### Completion Notes

All 7 tasks implemented and verified. 459 tests pass, TypeScript clean.
- **Task 1**: `vitest-axe` installed; `test-setup.ts` extended with `toHaveNoViolations` + global `matchMedia` stub; `vitest-axe.d.ts` type declaration added for Vitest 4.x compatibility.
- **Task 2**: `App.a11y.test.tsx` — 2 axe integration tests (main view + settings view), all passing with `color-contrast` rule disabled for jsdom false-positives.
- **Task 3**: `useAccessibilityAnnouncer.ts` hook created; wired into `App.tsx`; handles isOptimizing, completion, streamError, and abort-clear transitions.
- **Task 4**: Fixed `SkillTreeTabBar.tsx`, `GoalSelector.tsx`, `SavedBuildsList.tsx` focus indicators. Left `ClassMasterySelector.tsx` as-is (Headless UI manages internally).
- **Task 5**: `SuggestionCard.tsx` ariaLabel now includes `Damage: X → Y`, `Survivability: X → Y`, `Speed: X → Y` with null formatted as em dash.
- **Task 6**: `useReducedMotion.ts` created; `RendererInstance` interface updated; `pixiRenderer.ts` skips glow halo when reduced motion enabled; `SkillTreeCanvas.tsx` propagates the flag.
- **Task 7**: Full test suite green (459 tests).

## Review Findings

> **Code review complete.** 0 `decision-needed`, 6 `patch`, 5 `defer`, 6 dismissed as noise.
> Acceptance Auditor layer failed (rate limit) — findings may be incomplete against spec.

### Patch Items

- [ ] [Review][Patch] `contextmenu` listener added to canvas in `initRenderer` is never removed in `destroy()` — memory leak / orphaned handler under StrictMode double-mount [`lebo/src/features/skill-tree/pixiRenderer.ts`]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] `useReducedMotion` calls `window.matchMedia(...)` at the top of the hook body, creating a new `MediaQueryList` object on every render — use `useRef` to memoize across renders [`lebo/src/shared/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts`]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Reduced motion flag is not applied before the first `renderTree` call at init, and changing `reducedMotion` after mount does not trigger a re-render of the tree — call `renderTree` inside the `setReducedMotion` useEffect [`lebo/src/features/skill-tree/SkillTreeCanvas.tsx:174`]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] `setRegion` clear→rAF→set pattern drops "Analyzing your build..." announcement when optimization completes before the rAF fires (rapid transitions) — cancel pending rAF or coalesce with a tracked rAF id [`lebo/src/shared/hooks/useAccessibilityAnnouncer.ts`]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] Arrow-key navigation silently dead-ends when all connected nodes are outside the current viewport — no feedback to the user; add a screen-reader announcement or call `onKeyboardNavigate(null, 0, 0)` [`lebo/src/features/skill-tree/SkillTreeCanvas.tsx:237`]
- [ ] [Review][Patch] `initialState` captured at `describe` scope (evaluated once at module load) — dirty baseline if prior tests mutate the store; move inside `beforeEach` [`lebo/src/App.a11y.test.tsx:52`]

### Deferred Items

- [x] [Review][Defer] Button positions stuck at origin if container has zero dimensions at mount [`lebo/src/features/skill-tree/SkillTreeCanvas.tsx:145`] — deferred, production always has a real layout; test mock correctly overrides getBoundingClientRect
- [x] [Review][Defer] BFS Tab order is undefined on cyclic or bidirectional edge graphs [`lebo/src/features/skill-tree/SkillTreeCanvas.tsx:34`] — deferred, Last Epoch skill trees are DAGs; not a real scenario
- [x] [Review][Defer] "Preview / Apply / Skip" action buttons have no per-suggestion accessible name [`lebo/src/features/optimization/SuggestionCard.tsx:212`] — deferred, pre-existing; axe audit passes; parent article aria-label provides context
- [x] [Review][Defer] `#ai-status-region` and `#critical-error-region` DOM elements are absent when settings view is active [`lebo/src/App.tsx`] — deferred, pre-existing structural design; optimization cannot run from settings view
- [x] [Review][Defer] `o`/`i` keyboard shortcuts silently no-op via optional chaining when target element is unmounted [`lebo/src/App.tsx:107,113`] — deferred, pre-existing (6.1 carry-over); intentional defensive pattern
